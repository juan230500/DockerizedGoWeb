**Project Description: Dockerized Go Web Service**

This project showcases the implementation of a simple HTTP GET web service in Go, which is containerized using Docker. The service responds to requests with the message "Hello, Docker!" and is deployed inside a Docker container.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- **Go Programming:** The project demonstrates proficiency in Go programming. It includes the development of a basic web server using the standard "net/http" package to efficiently handle HTTP requests and responses.

- **Web Development:** A fundamental understanding of web development is demonstrated by creating a web server that listens for HTTP GET requests on the "/hello" route and responds with the message "Hello, Docker!".

- **Containerization with Docker:** The project showcases the ability to containerize a Go web service using Docker. The Dockerfile is skillfully crafted to build a Docker image containing the web service and its dependencies.

- **Docker Image Creation:** The Docker image creation process is handled effectively, resulting in an encapsulated environment for the Go web service.

- **Docker Container Deployment:** The successful deployment of a Docker container, hosting and running the Go web service, demonstrates proficiency in managing containerized applications.

**Project Structure:**

- `main.go`: Contains the code for the Go web service. It efficiently handles incoming HTTP GET requests and responds with the message "Hello, Docker!".

- `Dockerfile`: Defines the necessary steps to build a Docker image for the Go web service, ensuring a lightweight and self-contained container.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

2. Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t my-go-web-service .
```

3. Run the Docker container:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 my-go-web-service
```

4. Access the service:

   Open your web browser or use tools like `curl` or `wget` to access the service at `http://localhost:8080/hello`. The response should be "Hello, Docker!".

**Conclusion:**

This project exemplifies a high level of competence in Go programming, web development, and Docker containerization. It successfully delivers a web service that responds to HTTP GET requests, demonstrates proficiency in containerization using Docker, and showcases the ability to deploy web services within a containerized environment. The skills demonstrated in this project are valuable for modern software development and deployment practices.
